Lyall's Sports Network

A sports website that displays professional sports standings that I created for a Per Scholas project.

Motivation: There is nothing I'd rather watch than a good sports game. So I created an ESPN like website for a sports network I would love to run in the future.

The website is a place for you to get the NBA and NFL standings. The website is very simple to navigate, just follow the navigation bar at the top and it will take you wherever you need to go. This program calls on multiple API's to get the standings data for the NFL and NBA.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and API's for this project.

In the future I would like to add more sports and a ton of statistics for each of those sports. I would like to add sports betting odds and information as this was my original inspiration for this project. I would also like to start writing sports articles and posting them here. I think this page has tons of potential to grow.

A problem I could not solve was the NBA logos on the right side of the screen lining up evenly. I also had minor issues with the MLB part of this webpage, which is why it is no longer available on this website at the moment.
